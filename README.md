# Blinkit Grocery Sales Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze Blinkit's grocery sales data to identify key business insights and trends. By leveraging Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard to visualize sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory distribution. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, and creating DAX measures to generate meaningful insights.

##  Power BI Questions Addressed: 
1. What is the total revenue, total items sold, and average sales?
2. How do sales vary across different outlet types and locations?
3. How does fat content impact total sales?
4. What is the correlation between outlet size and total sales?
5. How do sales trends change over time?
6. What are the key insights for business optimization?

## Process of the Project: 
Step 1: Data Collection & Cleaning
1. Collected raw data in an Excel file containing grocery sales transactions.
2. Cleaned and formatted data using Power Query (handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized column names).

Step 2: Data Transformation & Modeling
1. Created relationships between tables for better data connectivity.
2. Applied SQL queries for data extraction and aggregation.
3. Developed DAX measures to calculate: Total Sales,Average Sales,Number of Items Sold,Average Customer Rating,Percentage Sales Contribution by Fat Content, Outlet Type, and Location
Step 3: Power BI Dashboard Development
1. Designed an interactive dashboard with:Key KPIs for sales metrics.Charts & Visuals: Bar, Pie, Line, Donut, and Matrix charts to display trends.Filters & Slicers for data drill-down by outlet type, size, and location.Sales Insights based on various parameters.
